# transfer-learning-with-Efficientnetb7-tensorflow2.3


*This repo implements a simple efficientnetB7 from tensorflow 2.3 instance.
*This is implemented for a 10 class classification and you can modify it for your need.
*The network is trained from the scratch (Feature extraction+classification)
*You can split your data using the code in data_split.py and split according to your requirement
*If you are running it on server you can later use your log file and process it to plot your training performance using processinglogfile.py
